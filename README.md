# Packet Tracer Project

A repository demonstrating that Cisco Packet Tracer files (.pkt) can be successfully tracked using Git version control.

## About

This project was created to verify and showcase that Packet Tracer network simulation files can be effectively managed with Git, enabling version control for network topology designs and configurations.

## Repository Contents

- `Packet Tracer.pkt` - A Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation file

## What is Packet Tracer?

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows you to:
- Design and build virtual networks
- Configure network devices (routers, switches, etc.)
- Test network connectivity and protocols
- Practice networking concepts in a safe, simulated environment

## Version Control for .pkt Files

This repository proves that:
- ✅ Packet Tracer `.pkt` files can be tracked by Git
- ✅ Changes to network topologies can be versioned
- ✅ Collaboration on network designs is possible through Git workflows

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webmancer1/Packet-Tracer-Project.git
   ```

2. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer

3. Modify the network topology as needed

4. Commit your changes to track the evolution of your network design

## Requirements

- Cisco Packet Tracer (download from [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/))

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and experiment with tracking your own Packet Tracer projects using Git!
